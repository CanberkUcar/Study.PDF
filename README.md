# Study.PDF

Currently main branch : master.

I am only studying from the pdf's and videos for the most of my university life. So why won't I try to develop a decent reader?

/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to Run / Use

Currently it's working by placing the pdf's on the folder of

```sh
Study.PDF/docs
```

On the main.js file you can direct the pdf that you want to open by manually. This will change in the future of course.

Run the file with "live server" on VSCode itself. It will starting-up on your port. If you don't know how to use VSCode Live Server
check : 'videolink'
